## Reads RACAL gear wear data

It has the only purpose to read the dataset and extract a vector of rms vibration through time passed

The RACAL gear wear dataset can be found at [GOTIX](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/projet/gotix/gearwear.html)

## Simulations

Performs estimations about future values, the data set was cropped to validate the estimators.

Was implemented RNN, Polinominal Least Squares and ARX Recursive Least Squares.
